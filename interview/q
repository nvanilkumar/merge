However, the most noteworthy difference is that CONCAT might not return the results you are expecting for 
cases where any of the inputs are NULL. In these cases CONCAT will return NULL whereas 
CONCAT_WS will skip NULL values and still return a string with the result of the remaining inputs. 
This means that in most cases you will probably want to use CONCAT_WS.
