Make Facebook Great Again
========

Do you remember the good ol days of Facebook? Back when it was just buzzfeed quizzes and poke wars? No political rants from your uncle or your insufferable roommate.

I stand before you today to say that now, there is a solution. No longer must we accept the polarization, shouting into echo chambers and political grandstanding on our news feeds!

It's time to take our news feed back! It's time we **Make Facebook Great Again.**
